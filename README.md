Unifying Inference of Meso-Scale Structures in Networks

This is an updated (better?) version of what is explained in our paper [1]. If you want to use the outdated one at your own risk you can reach it under the directory "paper_version_old_and_unstable".

As an optimization algorithm, this new version still uses simulated annealing and thereby still very slow. Please do not hesitate to use another optimization approach instead. If you do this, I'll be glad to hear from you, and possibly implement your solution (tuncb [at] email [dot] chop [dot] edu).

Unfortunately, no documentation is available as of now, except inline comments, which should be enough for a simple use. You may contact me if further assistance is needed.

This version also implements a more advanced generative model described in another paper [2], but no example or documentation is provided yet.
